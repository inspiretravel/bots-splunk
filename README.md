<h1> Getting started with splunk for secuirty</h1>

This workshop is designed to be hands-on and is using the BOTS 1.0 dataset. The goal of this workshop is to provide a better understanding of how Splunk can be used to better answer security questions that may occur within your environment. During this workshop, we will introduce you to searching with Splunk and walk through questions that are similar to those in the BOTS competition and develop searches that will help answer them.
